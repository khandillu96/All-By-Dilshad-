file handling :-
suppose we have/want to create file and folder on server.
so wecan create file & folder and called file system function(FSF).

with tha help of FSF we create file and folder on server and read ,write & delete file etc.  

mostly file format we create on server it is:
1) Text file.
2) json file.
3) csv file.
