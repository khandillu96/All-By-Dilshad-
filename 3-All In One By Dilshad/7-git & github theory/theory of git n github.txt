Git command:-


version: git --version

set name email for new git user: 
git config --global user.name "dilshad khan"
git config --global user.email "dilshadk321@gmail.com"

madir: mkdir dir_name;
mkdir ke adnder ane k lie: cd dir_name\
git init(.git file will create)
(note if folder select no need to do mkdir concept)
want to see .git file : ls -a


Status : git status(if show untrack file so Add file use after add tracked show)
Add    : git add file_name(single fille add)
Add    : git add . (multiple file add)
commit : git commit -m "some messege here"
want to see commit : git log(for all)
want to see commit : git log --oneline(for single line)
want to see commit : git log --oneline -2,-3,-4(for multiple line)


suppose we have to go 1st file before modified: git checkout #code(git log se copy karna hai);
note:  if before modified file get all file will delete .. if we want back all file:git  checkout master

branch:
create branch : git branch branch_name
cehckout brnch : git checkout branch_name (then log breanch_name)

merge :(first come branch by checkout command)
then--> git merger branch_name;



want to se branch and remote name:
git branch 
git remote









push:
local
1) git add (file_name/repo_name)
2) git commit
remote
3) git remote add [remote_name]  [REPO #code on GITHUB]
4) git push -u [remote_name] [branch_name]
note - if modified local then need to do again same process 
note - if modified remote then need to do pull/fetch process





pull and fetch:
pull(edit on remote):
1) git pull [remote_name] [branch_name]


fecth(edit on remote):
1)git fetch [remote_name]
2)git merger[remote_name]/[branch_name]

git pull download allover changes which are present in over remote website  apply is it..
git fetch download allover changes which are present in over remote website but dose not apply is it ,if want to apply need to merger it...
note (fetch are safer method as compare to pull);







clone:(supose we dont have any file/repo which are avilable on github that  file/repo want from  github use cloe )
1)copy clone url from github repo
2)git clone [paste clone url here]
